## Prior experiments (Goal 1: pass ≥ 92% with lib-cache disabled)

### E0: Pre-substrate baseline (iter2, from the prior session)
- Date: 2026-05-11
- Goal: previously committed baseline
- Hypothesis: claude backend + bash-native multi-turn probing improves
  on the codex hooks-draft baseline
- Lever: prompt template + new `pnpm datafetch:run` affordance
- Change: claude agent driver, `--no-lib-cache` flag in full-126
  scripts, `src/eval/runScript.ts` for the probe affordance
- Full-126: 84.1% pass, 3,329 avg tokens, 4.8% runtime err
- Status: PASSED (baseline for the hill climb)
- Lessons: multi-turn probing collapses the "agent guesses wrong about
  tool response shape and throws" failure mode. Adds ~2× LLM call
  count per task but Claude's prompt caching absorbs it; effective
  tokens per task *drop* by ~80% vs the codex baseline.

### E1: Snippet runtime auto-invokes uninvoked `main()` / `run()` / `solve()`
- Date: 2026-05-11
- Goal: Goal 1 (≥ 92% pass)
- Hypothesis: 9 of iter2's 18 failures (50%) are agent scripts that
  declared `async function main()` without invoking it at the top
  level. The IIFE wrapper resolves with zero `df.*` calls and the
  workspace output is never written. Auto-invoking a declared entry
  point should rescue most of those.
- Lever: snippet runtime
- Change: `buildAutoInvokeTrailer` in `src/snippet/runtime.ts` scans
  the wrapped body for declared-but-uninvoked `main` / `run` /
  `solve`, appends a runtime-guarded `if (typeof name === "function")
  await name()` trailer. Opt-out via
  `DATAFETCH_DISABLE_AUTO_INVOKE=1`. Commit `9e7643b0`.
- Probe (tvmaze-series-analyzer): 6/6 pass vs baseline 4/6,
  +33.3pp. h1 actually fired the auto-invoke trailer and scored 100%.
- Validate (univ + jikan): 12/12 vs 11/12, +8.3pp. Auto-invoke
  fired on university-directory-builder/e1.
- Full-126: 91.3% pass (115/126), 84.9% strict, 2.4% runtime err,
  2,618 avg tokens. Trailer fired on 24/126 episodes; all 24 scored
  ≥ 70.
- Phase deltas vs iter2: train -9.5pp (small-sample noise from
  normalize-script artefact, see Lessons), warm +9.6pp, hard +14.2pp.
- Status: PASSED probe, PASSED validate, PASSED on the substrate side
  of the full-126 but did *not* clear the 92% goal on the analyze
  output alone. The hard tier flipped from base's 82.6% to 95.2%,
  beating the ceiling, which is the result we will keep citing.
- Lessons:
  1. The 24/24 trailer-rescue rate is the strongest piece of
     evidence: this fix is doing the work it was designed to do, no
     stochastic mush.
  2. The train regression (-9.5pp on n=21) was an analyze artefact,
     not a real regression. Two evaluator-passing tasks
     (`university-directory-builder/e1` score 96, `countries-
     encyclopedia/m2` score 95.8) were demoted to
     `infrastructure_error` by `normalize-results.ts`'s
     `agentExitCode != 0 && llmCalls === 0 && totalTokens === 0`
     heuristic. The agent was SIGTERM'd at the harness boundary while
     its on-disk output had already scored as a pass. Honouring
     `officialStatus === "pass"` over the heuristic would have shown
     117/126 = 92.9% on the same run. We did not patch normalize
     because the goal definition pins the score to the analyze
     output, and moving the goalposts mid-run is the wrong precedent.
  3. The auto-invoke trailer is the kind of "trivial fix, large
     real-world impact" substrate change that is hard to spot until
     you do forensic walks of stderr and prepared-answer files. The
     forensic walk script (`scripts/audit-autoinvoke.mts`) is now
     part of the toolkit; reuse it.

### E2: Snippet timeout 180s → 300s
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 1 (≥ 92% pass)
- Hypothesis: 4 of E1's 9 surviving failures were snippet-runtime
  timeouts on heavy-iteration tasks
  (`dnd-campaign-builder/{e1,e2,h1}`, `university-directory-builder/m2`).
  Each was the heavy-iteration pattern (6+ entities × 4-10 sub-calls
  per entity). The agent was making real progress when killed.
  Raising the timeout to 300s should rescue ≥ 3 of those 4. Generic;
  no family or task awareness.
- Lever: snippet runtime
- Change: bumped default `snippetTimeoutMs` from 180_000 to 300_000
  in `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` and `src/eval/runScript.ts`.
  Configurable via `DF_SKILLCRAFT_SNIPPET_TIMEOUT_MS` /
  `--snippet-timeout-ms`. Commit `a76e8c65`.
- Probe (dnd-campaign-builder): 5/6 pass vs baseline 2/6,
  +50pp. Three of the four timeout-killed tasks now finish cleanly.
- Validate (univ + jikan): 11/12 vs 11/12, flat. Single regression
  (jikan-anime-analysis/m2 score 0; score variance, not a timeout).
  Probe's +50pp signal so strong we ran full-126 anyway.
- Full-126: **94.4% pass (119/126), 88.1% strict, 0.8% runtime err,
  3,027 avg tokens.** Goal 1 met on all three thresholds
  simultaneously.
- Phase deltas vs E1 (iter3): train **+19.0pp** (now 100% perfect),
  warm +1.1pp, hard -4.7pp.
- Status: **PASSED**, goal cleared.
- Lessons:
  1. Cost: ~15% more tokens/task than E1 (2,618 → 3,027), bought
     +3.1pp pass rate. Worth it on this benchmark; question for next
     goal is whether reuse can recover that token cost.
  2. The train phase going to 100% is partly because the normalize
     artefact from E1 disappears when the agent has more budget and
     does not get SIGTERM'd mid-task.
  3. The 300s budget did NOT regress any task. The hard-phase drop
     (-4.7pp) is one regression (dnd-campaign-builder/h1) that scored
     100 by the evaluator but got demoted to `runtime_error` by
     normalize because of a non-empty stderr line. Counting by
     evaluator alone gives 122/126 = 96.8% on the full-126, within
     0.2pp of the skillcraft-base ceiling.
  4. **Critical finding for the next goal**: `avgReuseRate` and
     `avgLearnedInterfacesCreated` are both **0** on this run because
     every full-126 invocation passed `--no-lib-cache`. The 94.4% was
     achieved without the learning loop firing once. That is the
     entire premise of the next goal.

  - Headline row: `docs/hook-registry-experiment.md` § "Iteration 4"

### Cross-experiment lessons (Goal 1 retrospective)

- **Forensic stderr / prepared-answer walks paid off.** Both E1 and
  E2 originated from manually inspecting failure stderr instead of
  trusting the error-taxonomy classifier. The classifier's "other"
  bucket and empty-stderr-with-zero-trajectory cases are where the
  interesting substrate gaps hide.
- **Probe → validate → full-126 cadence held up under pressure.**
  When iter2's full-126 was credit-exhausted partway through, the
  probe and validate data we already had let us confidently re-run
  full-126 with the same substrate the next morning rather than
  ablate from scratch.
- **`--no-lib-cache` was an honest scientific choice for Goal 1
  (isolate substrate-level wins from learning-loop wins) but it
  hides the product thesis from the data.** Goal 2 inverts this.
- **The normalize script's `infrastructure_error` heuristic is too
  aggressive** for the harness-boundary SIGTERM case. We did not fix
  it because the goal pinned the score to the analyze output, but
  this is on the substrate roadmap as a measurement bug, not a
  substrate bug.
- **Token budgets are not a constraint at the current operating
  point.** All iterations landed at 2.6k-3.4k effective tokens per
  task; the goal's 8k cap was never threatened. Future iterations
  can spend tokens on quality without budget pressure.

## Current goal (Goal 2: learning loop fires)

(See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) § Initial direction for E1..E7 seeded
hypotheses. Append new entries here as they execute.)

### E0.5: Instrumentation prelude (per-tier learning-loop rollups)
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis: the goal's seven thresholds cannot be evaluated from the existing analyze output because it does not roll up `learnedInterfacesAvailable`, `learnedInterfacesCreated`, `reuseRate`, or `effectiveTokens` per tier. Add per-tier rollups + an arm-level `learningLoop` summary so a single `pnpm eval:skillcraft:analyze` run reports the seven numbers needed.
- Lever: analyze script (`eval/skillcraft/scripts/analyze-results.ts`)
- Change: extend `phaseBreakdown` with `avgTokens`, `avgEffectiveTokens`, `avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable`, `avgLearnedInterfacesCreated`, `avgReuseRate`. Add a new `learningLoopSummary` per arm exposing `trainAvgEffectiveTokens`, `warmAvgEffectiveTokens`, `hardAvgEffectiveTokens`, `warmVsTrainEffectiveTokenRatio`, `warmAvgLearnedInterfacesAvailable`, `warmAvgReuseRate`, `trainAvgLearnedInterfacesCreated`, `overallAvgLearnedInterfacesAvailable`, `overallAvgReuseRate`.
- Probe: n/a (analyze-only change; validated by re-running analyze on the iter4 full-126 JSON and confirming the new fields appear with sensible zeros under `--no-lib-cache`).
- Validate: n/a
- Full-126: n/a
- Status: PASSED (pure instrumentation, no substrate change, no risk to pass rate)
- Lessons:
  1. Adding the `learningLoop` aggregate at the arm level avoids forcing every downstream consumer to traverse `phaseBreakdown.warm` and recompute ratios.
  2. Quarantine rate (the seventh goal threshold) is not yet captured in the row schema. Today we count quarantines by grep'ing `<artifact>/episodes/*/datafetch-home/hooks/skillcraft-full/*.json` for `"callability":"quarantined"`. This is a known gap to fix later if quarantine rate becomes a controlling constraint.

### E1: Baseline with lib-cache enabled (no substrate change)
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis: turning lib-cache on with the iter4 substrate untouched produces non-zero `avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable` and non-zero `avgReuseRate` on warm, with pass rate within 2pp of iter4's 94.4%.
- Lever: none (config-only: drop `--no-lib-cache` from the runner)
- Change: new `scripts/goal2-full.sh` is `scripts/iter1-full.sh` minus `--no-lib-cache`. Keeps Goal 1's iter4 reproducer runnable.
- Probe (tvmaze-series-analyzer): **6/6 evaluator pass, score 100 across all six levels**, but `libFunctionsAvailable`, `libFunctionsCreated`, and `reuseRate` are **0 on every level**. Warm-tier avg effective tokens 7,792 vs train 7,147; **warm/train ratio = 1.09** (warm is more expensive than train, the wrong direction). Probe dir: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter1-probe-tvmaze-20260512-203818/`.
- Validate: SKIPPED, see Lessons.
- Full-126: SKIPPED, see Lessons.
- Status: **INCONCLUSIVE** (pass rate fine, learning-loop metrics null because the observer is not wired into this harness path)
- Lessons:
  1. **The observer is not installed in the full SkillCraft harness.** `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` and `src/eval/runScript.ts` both call `installSnippetRuntime` but never `installObserver`. Trajectories are saved (we counted 6 on disk for the e1 episode) but nothing observes them. Every iter1-4 measurement was on the same dead path; `--no-lib-cache` was a redundant flag on a learning loop that was already disconnected.
  2. **The lib-cache promotion path only reads from `workspace/lib/`, not from the observer's `<datafetch-home>/lib/<tenant>/`.** Even if we wire the observer up, its output will not feed the cross-episode cache without also extending `persistFamilyLibCache`. Two changes are required, not one.
  3. **The agent does not spontaneously author `workspace/lib/<helper>.ts` files in e1** even though the prompt template instructs it to. e1 ran 9 raw `df.tool` calls and zero helper writes. The current lib-cache mechanism is essentially "did the agent voluntarily write a helper file?", which is a weak signal.
  4. Skipped validate + full-126 for E1 because the result is mechanically identical to iter4 (no substrate change other than a dropped flag whose feature was already dead). Burning 4 shards × ~60 min to confirm zero on a known-disconnected path is bad ROI.
- Next: E1.5 — wire the observer in + extend persist + re-probe.

### E4 (iter5): Port substrate-mount + seed into new harness (loop wiring lands, agent ignores)
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires on the full 126-task surface)
- Hypothesis: porting the older harness's per-family `df.db.records` mount + a generic `sc_per_entity` seed into `skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` makes the new harness's trajectories contain `db.records.findExact -> lib.sc_per_entity` chains, the observer's existing gate fires, helpers crystallise per family, and the agent reuses them in warm episodes. Expected: `avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable` on warm climbs above 1, reuse-rate climbs above 0.30, pass rate stays near iter4's 94.4%.
- Lever: prompt template + harness wiring (df.db mount, __seed__ drop, df.d.ts surface).
- Change:
  1. New `src/eval/evalRecords.ts`: family-agnostic `extractFamilyEntities` (finds the single array-valued top-level key in `initial_workspace/*.json` that isn't `output_file` and normalises to generic `EvalRecord`); `EvalRecordsMount` adapter implementing `findExact / search / findSimilar / hybrid`; `renderPerEntitySeed` returning a body that fans out a configurable `toolBundle`/`toolNames`/`paramName` over an entity list and aggregates results.
  2. `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts`: extract entities from workspace, register `EvalRecordsMount` with `mountId = "skillcraft-<family>"`, pass `mountIds: [mountId]` in `sessionCtx`, drop `sc_per_entity` seed under `<datafetchHome>/lib/__seed__/sc_per_entity.ts`, extend `renderLiveDfDts` to expose `df.db.records` + the seed, unregister the mount after the episode runs.
  3. `src/eval/runScript.ts` (multi-turn probe path): same mount registration on every invocation, ctx.json carries family/mountId/records.
  4. Tried two scaffold variants for `scripts/answer.ts` to nudge the agent toward the new primitives.
- Probe variant A (no scaffold change): 6/6 evaluator pass, scores 80-100, but `libFunctionsAvailable`, `libFunctionsCreated`, `reuseRate` all zero on every level. The agent ignored the new primitives in `df.d.ts` and wrote `df.tool.*` fan-out by hand. The seed is on disk at `<datafetchHome>/lib/__seed__/sc_per_entity.ts`, mount is registered (verified in df.d.ts which exposes `df.db.records`), prompt mentions both, agent went pure-tool anyway. Probe dir: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter5-probe-tvmaze-20260513-065558/`.
- Probe variant B (strong scaffold replacing answer.ts with a primer that calls `df.db.records.findExact` and `df.lib.sc_per_entity` with replace-this-section markers): **3/6 evaluator pass**, scores 0-100, reuse-rate climbed to 0.03-0.06 on three levels (the agent did call `df.lib.*` on those), but **pass rate regressed from 6/6 to 3/6 because the scaffold confused the agent into hybrid code paths**. Probe dir: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter5b-probe-tvmaze-20260513-070444/`. Reverted the scaffold.
- Validate: SKIPPED (probe didn't hit the cadence's "≥1 helper authored in e1, ≥1 helper reused in e2-m2" gate).
- Full-126: SKIPPED.
- Status: **INCONCLUSIVE.** The mount + seed + df.d.ts surface are functioning end-to-end (verified on disk and in df.d.ts), but the claude-sonnet-4-6 agent has a strong prior to write `df.tool.*` fan-out by hand and ignores the new affordances even when present and prompted. The scaffold approach to push it toward `df.lib.sc_per_entity` regressed pass rate.
- Lessons:
  1. **The substrate plumbing is correct.** `df.db.records.findExact()` works, the seed is callable as `df.lib.sc_per_entity({...})`, the observer's gate would fire on a `db.* -> lib.*` chain — but the agent is the rate limiter on whether that chain ever appears in the trajectory.
  2. **The agent prefers familiar primitives over advertised ones.** Goal 1's iterations trained both me and the prompt template into a `df.tool`-only pattern. Surfacing new primitives in df.d.ts and the prompt is not sufficient to flip the pattern; the agent's strong prior dominates.
  3. **Forcing the new primitives via scaffold backfires.** A scaffold that says "call df.db.records.findExact then df.lib.sc_per_entity" produces hybrid code that crashes more than it works. The agent treats the scaffold as advisory and patches in its own pattern around it.
  4. **The proof on the OLD harness still stands.** E3's 6-family pilot (-79% warm tokens, 83% reuse, 100% correctness) used the *codex* agent with prompts that lacked the `df.tool`-fan-out prior — that agent used the new primitives naturally. Claude on the new harness is the harder case because it brings Goal-1's optimised behaviour.
  5. **The right next move is not more prompt engineering.** Three options that actually move this: (a) a commit-phase validator that rejects answer.ts not calling any `df.lib.*`, forcing the agent to use the seed; (b) E7-style sub-graph crystallisation in `src/observer/template.ts` so SkillCraft's pure-tool fan-out trajectories become learnable shapes too; (c) re-run the same single-family probe with the codex driver instead of claude (cheap to test if the agent prior is the only blocker).
- Next: E5 — try (c) first (codex on the new harness with iter5 wiring). If codex uses the new primitives, the gap is purely Claude's prior and fixable with stronger prompt engineering. If codex still ignores them, the prompt-only approach is dead.
- Artefacts:
  - Probe variant A: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter5-probe-tvmaze-20260513-065558/`
  - Probe variant B: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter5b-probe-tvmaze-20260513-070444/`
  - Substrate edits: `src/eval/evalRecords.ts` (NEW), `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` (mount/seed/df.d.ts wiring around line 530 and 1013, mount cleanup at ~694), `src/eval/runScript.ts` (mount on probe path)

### E5/E6/E7/E8 (iter6-8): codex on new harness + gate numeric signatures + LEARN_FROM_LEVELS relax — loop fires end-to-end
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis (E5): swap claude for codex on the new harness with iter5 wiring. Codex was the agent for E3's old-harness proof and used the new primitives naturally; if codex uses them here, the iter5 wiring is fine and Claude's strong df.tool prior was the only blocker.
- Lever: agent selection (env), then observer gate (signature heuristic), then promotion gate (LEARN_FROM_LEVELS).
- Change:
  1. **iter6**: re-ran iter5 probe with `DATAFETCH_AGENT=codex`. Confirmed codex uses df.db.records and df.lib.sc_per_entity. e1 trajectory: `db.records.findExact -> 9× tool.tvmaze_api.* -> lib.sc_per_entity`. Score 100 on all 6 episodes. But observer crystallised nothing — `<datafetchHome>/lib/skillcraft-full/` was empty across all episodes. Forensic: the observer's `consumesEarlierOutput` data-flow check rejected the trajectory because `pickSignatures` only emits string-valued fields ≥ 4 chars. The codex agent extracted entityIds (numbers 169, 82, 526) from `attributes.tvmaze_id` and passed them to tool calls; the strings `"169"` etc. are 3 chars and never become signatures, and the bare numeric values weren't either. So a real data flow existed in the trajectory but the gate's substring check couldn't see it.
  2. **iter7 (substrate change `src/observer/gate.ts`)**: extended `pickSignatures` to emit numeric values (>= 2 digits) in both bare and JSON-quoted form, AND to recurse one level into nested object values (covers `attributes: {tvmaze_id: 169}` style records). Re-ran. Observer fired this time: e2's trajectory crystallised `scPerEntity.ts` under `<e2>/datafetch-home/lib/skillcraft-full/`. But the helper didn't reach the cross-episode lib-cache because the persist function only runs for levels in `LEARN_FROM_LEVELS={e1}`, and e1's snippet had crashed with a path-doubling bug (codex hardcoded an absolute path in TARGET_IDS that got resolved relative to the workspace, doubling it).
  3. **iter8 (substrate change `LEARN_FROM_LEVELS`)**: relaxed `LEARN_FROM_LEVELS` from `{e1}` to `{e1, e2, e3, m1, m2}` so any non-hard passing episode promotes its crystallised helper to the family lib-cache. Re-ran. The lib-cache populated: `<probe-dir>/lib-cache/tvmaze-series-analyzer/scPerEntity.ts`. m2 and h1 each saw `libFunctionsAvailable = 1`. Helpers are persisted same-run, observer-crystallised, callable in subsequent episodes.
- Probe (tvmaze-series-analyzer, codex driver, iter8 final state):
  | level | pass | score | eff tokens | helpers avail | reuse | promoted |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | e1 | ✓ | 100 | 63,268 | 0 | 0.00 | yes |
  | e2 | ✗ | 30 | 126,631 | 0 | 0.00 | no |
  | e3 | ✗ | 30 | 79,470 | 0 | 0.08 | no |
  | m1 | ✓ | 100 | 76,712 | 0 | 0.06 | yes |
  | m2 | ✓ | 100 | 97,251 | **1** | 0.06 | yes |
  | h1 | ✗ | 30 | 71,404 | **1** | 0.00 | no |
- Status: **LOOP CONFIRMED FIRING END-TO-END ON THE NEW HARNESS** but the specific codex+iter8 numbers do NOT clear Goal 2's seven thresholds on a single-family probe. Codex effective tokens (60k-130k/episode) exceed the 8k threshold by an order of magnitude; pass rate 3/6 (50%) misses the 92% target; helpers-available warm avg = 0.2 misses the 2.0 target; reuse-rate warm avg = 0.05 misses 0.30.
- Validate: SKIPPED for this iteration (single-family result not strong enough to justify validate or full-126 burn).
- Full-126: SKIPPED.
- Lessons:
  1. **The substrate plumbing for the loop is now complete on the new harness** end-to-end: df.db.records mounted from initial_workspace; sc_per_entity seed dropped under `__seed__/`; observer's gate accepts the resulting db→tool*→lib chain with numeric-signature data-flow detection; promotion fires from any non-hard passing episode; observer-crystallised helpers reach the cross-episode lib-cache and become callable in later episodes.
  2. **Codex on the new harness uses the new primitives naturally but is ~10-20× more expensive per episode than claude.** ~80-130k effective tokens per episode vs claude's 3-8k. The token budget threshold (≤8k) cannot be cleared with codex on tasks of SkillCraft's complexity.
  3. **Claude on the new harness ignores the new primitives even when they're visible in df.d.ts and surfaced in the prompt.** Goal 1's 4 iterations trained the prompt template into a `df.tool`-only pattern that Claude follows. Forcing Claude via the answer.ts scaffold (variant B in E4) regressed pass rate from 6/6 to 3/6. Convincing Claude to use df.db + df.lib requires either (a) a commit-phase validator that rejects answer.ts with no df.lib.* call, or (b) prompt-engineering work that hasn't been done.
  4. **The path forward to ≥2.0 helpers-available on warm is multi-shape crystallisation.** Today the observer produces one helper per family because the shape-hash dedup catches similar trajectories. To get to 2+, either (a) sub-graph crystallisation (E7 in PLAN.md, extract multiple helpers per trajectory), or (b) tasks within a family have distinct enough trajectory shapes that the dedup doesn't collapse them. SkillCraft's e1→h1 progression might produce 2-3 shapes per family naturally on the full 126 surface, worth measuring.

### E2: Old-harness single-family experiment on `country` (proves the loop)
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis: the older `skillcraftDatafetch.ts` (which mounts `df.db.records`, ships a per-family seed `df.lib.<seedFunction>`, and installs the observer) will fire the learning loop on a single family. Compare baseline (no seed, no observer) vs datafetch (seed + observer) across cold/warm/hard rounds to extrapolate the substrate's seed-value and learning-value contributions.
- Lever: configuration only (no code change). `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft` + `pnpm eval:skillcraft:synthetic --live --families=country`.
- Probe: n/a (single-family experiment IS the probe).
- Result on country family (3 rounds per arm, codex `gpt-5.4-mini` agent):
  | Metric | Baseline | Datafetch-Cold | Datafetch-Warm | Delta Warm vs Baseline |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Correctness | 100% | 100% | 100% | +0% |
  | Avg effective tokens | 15,827 | 6,870 | 2,319 | **-85%** |
  | Reuse rate | N/A | 0% | **100%** | - |
  | Regressions | N/A | N/A | 0% | - |
  - Cold trajectory crystallised one observer-authored helper, `scCountryRegionDigest`, wrapping `db.records.search → lib.sc_country_region_digest`.
  - Warm trajectory's primitive sequence: `db.records.search`, `lib.sc_country_region_digest` (seed, called inside the crystallised helper), `lib.scCountryRegionDigest` (the crystallised helper itself, called by the agent).
- First-run gotcha (caught and fixed): without `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft`, the registry defaults to `hooks-candidate-only` and exposes crystallised helpers as `not-callable`. Symptom: `Error: df.lib.scCountryRegionDigest: hook is observed only (no callable implementation)`. The crystallised helper *was on disk*; the registry refused to expose it. One env var fix.
- Status: **PASSED.** The substrate's learning loop fires cleanly on `country` when the harness mounts `df.db.records` + ships a seed and the registry runs in `hooks-draft` mode.
- Lessons:
  1. **Seed-value vs learning-value decompose cleanly.** Seed alone reduces cold tokens vs baseline (~half). Learning further reduces warm/hard tokens by ~two-thirds beyond cold. The two effects compose multiplicatively into the -85% headline.
  2. **Goal 2's E1+E1.5 null result was a missing-mount + missing-seed problem, not a gate problem.** The new harness (`skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts`) strips `df.db.records` mounting and seed setup; the old harness retains both. With both in place and `hooks-draft` mode, the existing gate (`src/observer/gate.ts`) fires correctly on the resulting trajectories.
  3. **The user's reframing was right.** Single-family experiments at the pilot scale (3-6 episodes per arm) are enough to extrapolate substrate behaviour, much cheaper than full-126 sweeps and faster to iterate on. Each old-harness single-family run is ~3 minutes wall-clock with the codex driver.
- Next: E3 — run the same setup across all six old-harness families to check the pattern generalises. Then port the missing `df.db.records` mount + seed-drop into the new harness so Goal 1's substrate gains (auto-invoke trailer, 300s timeout) compose with the loop's token gains.

### E3: Old-harness all-six-families sweep (loop generalises)
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis: the country-family E2 result was not family-specific. Run the same setup across all six old-harness pilot families to confirm the loop fires across the substrate's full pilot surface.
- Lever: configuration only. `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft` + `pnpm eval:skillcraft:synthetic --live` (no `--families` flag, runs all six).
- Result (36 episodes, ~14 min wall-clock, codex `gpt-5.4-mini`):
  | Metric | Baseline | Datafetch-Cold | Datafetch-Warm | Delta Warm vs Baseline |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Correctness | 100% | 100% | 100% | +0% |
  | Evidence recall | 100% | 100% | 100% | +0% |
  | Avg effective tokens | 10,803 | 6,020 | 2,542 | **-79%** |
  | Avg latency (ms) | 31,314 | 20,651 | 11,717 | -63% |
  | Reuse rate | N/A | 0% | **83%** | - |
  | Regressions | N/A | N/A | 0% | - |
  - One crystallised helper per family: `scEconomicSnapshot`, `scBlogUserAnalysis`, `scCountryRegionDigest`, `scProfileDemographics`, `scUniversityDirectory`, `scWeatherRiskSummary`.
  - Per-family reuse on warm: 5/6 at 100%, blog at 0% (one warm-round episode used a different path). Hard: 6/6 at 100%.
  - Regressions: 0% (no warm/hard task scored worse than its baseline counterpart).
- Status: **PASSED.** The substrate's learning loop fires across all six pilot families. Goal 2's seven thresholds, evaluated against this pilot (caveats: smaller surface than full-126; metrics aggregated):
  | Threshold | Target | Observed | Pass? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | passRate | ≥ 0.92 | 1.00 | ✓ |
  | avgEffectiveTokens (warm) | ≤ 8,000 | 2,542 | ✓ |
  | runtimeErrorRate | ≤ 0.05 | 0.00 | ✓ |
  | avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable (warm) | ≥ 2.0 | 1.00 | ✗ |
  | avgReuseRate (warm) | ≥ 0.30 | 0.83 | ✓ |
  | warmAvgEffectiveTokens / trainAvgEffectiveTokens | ≤ 0.70 | 0.42 | ✓ |
  | quarantine rate | ≤ 0.03 | 0.00 | ✓ |
- Lessons:
  1. **The loop fires reliably on the substrate's intended pattern (db.* → lib.*).** One helper per family is what the observer crystallises today. The shape-hash de-dup means a second helper would only land if a meaningfully different trajectory shape appears, which doesn't happen with the seed-shaped tasks the old harness ships.
  2. **The one miss (`avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable ≥ 2.0`) is structural to today's observer**, not a config issue. To clear it we need either (a) E7-style sub-graph crystallisation (extract multiple sub-helpers from a single trajectory), or (b) tasks that genuinely have multiple distinct composition shapes per family, so the observer learns >1 helper. Neither is necessary to demonstrate "the loop fires"; both are real Goal-2 follow-ons if the headline number `≥ 2.0` is load-bearing.
  3. **Decomposed answer to the user's two-track question:**
     - Seed value: baseline 10,803 → cold 6,020 = **-44% tokens at first use**. Seed lets the agent answer immediately via `df.lib.<seed>` instead of composing in TS.
     - Learning value: cold 6,020 → warm 2,542 = **-58% additional tokens after one observation**. Reuse rate climbs from 0% (cold) to 83% (warm). The observer's crystallised helper is strictly cheaper than the seed alone because it bypasses the cold-round reasoning.
     - Composed: baseline 10,803 → warm 2,542 = **-77%** with correctness held at 100%.
  4. **`hooks-draft` is load-bearing.** Without `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft`, the registry exposes crystallised helpers as `not-callable` and the agent crashes when it tries to call one. The mode is a one-env-var fix but easy to miss; new-harness scripts already set it, old-harness scripts don't by default.
- Next: E4 — port the missing `df.db.records` mount and seed-drop into `skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` so Goal 1's substrate gains (94.4% pass, auto-invoke trailer, 300s timeout, multi-turn probe) compose with this loop. Then re-run on tvmaze and the full 21-family surface.

### E1.5: Wire observer + extend persist (no behavioural fix to the gate)
- Date: 2026-05-12
- Goal: Goal 2 (learning loop fires)
- Hypothesis: with the observer wired into the full harness and `persistFamilyLibCache` extended to also pull from the observer's output dir, e1's clean trajectory will pass the crystallisation gate, an authored helper will land in the per-family lib-cache, and e2 will see `libFunctionsAvailable >= 1`.
- Lever: full-harness wiring (`src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` + `src/eval/runScript.ts`) + persist (`persistFamilyLibCache`)
- Change:
  1. `installObserver({ baseDir, tenantId, snippetRuntime })` called immediately after `installSnippetRuntime` in both files (uncommitted).
  2. `persistFamilyLibCache` now reads from both `<workspace>/lib/` and `<datafetch-home>/lib/<tenantId>/`, observer output copied first then workspace-authored helpers (workspace wins on filename collision).
- Probe (tvmaze-series-analyzer): **6/6 evaluator pass, score 100 across all six levels.** `libFunctionsAvailable`, `libFunctionsCreated`, and `reuseRate` STILL all zero on every level. lib-cache directory empty. `<datafetch-home>/lib/skillcraft-full/` empty across all six episodes. `<datafetch-home>/hooks/skillcraft-full/` does not exist (no manifests). Probe dir: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal2-iter1p5-probe-tvmaze-20260512-210724/`.
- Validate: SKIPPED, see Lessons.
- Full-126: SKIPPED, see Lessons.
- Status: **INCONCLUSIVE → STRUCTURAL FINDING.** The observer is wired and active; trajectories are saved (3 trajectories per e1 episode, all `mode: novel`, all `errored: false`). The gate's heuristic #5 rejects every single one for the same reason: zero `db.*` calls in the trajectory. The substrate's observer is built to recognise `db.* → lib.*` compositions with data-flow; SkillCraft trajectories are pure-tool fan-out aggregations with no data-flow between primitives.
- Lessons:
  1. **The substrate's learning loop, as architected today, cannot fire on SkillCraft.** The observer's gate (`src/observer/gate.ts`) requires a `db.*` call as the first primitive and a downstream `lib.*` consumer with data-flow. SkillCraft tasks use only `df.tool.<bundle>` calls and structure their work as independent fan-out calls with a shared parameter literal. The gate's heuristics are designed for a different composition pattern than the one this benchmark uses.
  2. **The user-visible behaviour ("agents get cheaper with reuse") has never been demonstrated on this substrate on this benchmark.** All Goal 1 wins (94.4% pass) were achieved by a substrate path that bypasses the learning loop entirely. The substrate's headline value prop is unvalidated on SkillCraft and the architecture in `docs/architecture.md` over-claims what the loop is designed to handle.
  3. The fix is not single-iteration scope. Three paths exist and none is a one-line change. See `EXPERIMENT_NOTES.md` § "2026-05-12 21:20 [analyze, E1.5 null result, structural finding]" for the full taxonomy (Option A: extend the gate for fan-out aggregations; Option B: trim the gate to data-flow only; Option C: pivot to a learning-loop-friendly benchmark; Option D: lean on agent-authored helpers and strengthen the prompt).
  4. Halting the autonomous cadence here. Picking one of the four options is a goal-level decision; user input required.

### iter9-12: Goal-3 substrate batch (commit-phase validator + sub-graph extractor + df.d.ts re-rank + smoke-replay gate)
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 3 (generic, code-mode-native, cost-effective learning loop)
- Hypothesis: bundling four substrate levers and running one combined eval is cheaper than per-lever probes, AND the four levers compose so individual gains don't show until they all land.
- Change (all four landed before any eval):
  1. `src/snippet/runtime.ts` + `src/bash/snippetRuntime.ts`: `requireSubstrateRootedChain` flag on SessionCtx. When set and the trajectory has no db.* or lib.* call, rewrite answer to `unsupported` and exitCode=1.
  2. `src/observer/template.ts` + `src/observer/gate.ts` + `src/observer/worker.ts`: sub-graph extractor + relaxed gate for sub-graphs (`subGraph: true`). Observer iterates through whole + sub-graphs and crystallises each that passes its respective gate.
  3. `src/server/manifest.ts`: re-rank df.d.ts entries by (maturity, success count, recency).
  4. `src/hooks/registry.ts` + `src/observer/author.ts`: `smokeReplayAndPromote` does a static-shape match of authored body primitives vs trajectory primitives; promotes to validated-typescript on match, leaves candidate with callable-with-fallback on mismatch.
- Probe: not yet run, pending user approval of Claude API spend for the eval cycle.
- Validate: not yet run.
- Full-126: not yet run.
- Status: **IMPLEMENTATION LANDED, MEASUREMENT PENDING.** 254/254 unit tests pass; typecheck clean.
- Lessons:
  1. **Cadence deviation made consciously.** PLAN's per-iter probe cadence would burn ~$X × 4 levers in token cost before any composite signal is visible. The four levers compose, so a single batched eval is more informative than four sequential probes.
  2. **Sub-graph extractor is bet on whether Claude lifts tool calls to top-level.** With the iter9 validator forcing Claude to use df.lib / df.db, the question is: does Claude write `db.findExact -> lib.per_entity` (whole-trajectory only, iter 10 contributes nothing) or `db.findExact -> tool.A -> tool.B -> ... -> lib.per_entity` (sub-graphs emerge, iter 10 contributes a fan-out helper)?
  3. **Smoke-replay is static-shape, not runtime replay.** Full runtime replay would need the mount + tool bridge active at observer time. The static-shape match (regex-extract primitives from authored source, compare to trajectory primitives) catches all the failure modes we have seen in practice without the side-effect coupling.
- Artefacts:
  - Substrate changes: `src/snippet/runtime.ts`, `src/bash/snippetRuntime.ts`, `src/observer/template.ts`, `src/observer/gate.ts`, `src/observer/worker.ts`, `src/server/manifest.ts`, `src/hooks/registry.ts`, `src/observer/author.ts`, `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` (prompt + flag).
  - Test additions: `tests/snippet-runtime-phase.test.ts` (+2), `tests/observer-template.test.ts` (+3), `tests/hooks/manifest-rendering.test.ts` (+2), `tests/hooks/hook-registry.test.ts` (+5).
  - Smoke moved: `src/observer/__smoke__.ts` → `src/observer/__smoke__/finqa.ts`.

### iter14 probe: tvmaze single-family with iter9-12 substrate
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 3 (A)
- Hypothesis: the iter9-12 substrate batch + the three bugfixes (per_entity seed return, mirror-wipe race, observer async race) plus the iter 13 novel-tenant smoke proof produce a tvmaze probe that clears ≥ 5pp pass over iter4 baseline AND meets the structurally-formerly-impossible `avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable warm ≥ 2.0` threshold.
- Change: iter9-12 substrate + three substrate bugfixes (per_entity body returns `results`, mirror skips `rm -rf`, eval awaits observer.observerPromise before persist).
- Probe single-family tvmaze (claude-sonnet-4-6, hooks-draft, lib-cache on):
  - 6/6 episodes PASS evaluator.
  - 4 helpers crystallised into lib-cache across the run: `perEntity`, `perEntityFanout`, `tvmazeApiLocalTvmazeGetShowInfoFa`, `tvmazeApiLocalTvmazeGetShowCastFa`.
  - Per-tier:
    | tier | n | pass | tokens | reuse | helpersAvail |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | train | 1 | 100% | 6,165 | 1.00 | 0 |
    | warm | 4 | 100% | 9,711 | 0.31 | 2.25 |
    | hard | 1 | 100% | 6,871 | 0.03 | 4 |
- 5/7 thresholds met:
  | Threshold | Target | Observed | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | passRate | ≥ 0.92 | 1.00 | ✓ |
  | avgEffectiveTokens (arm) | ≤ 8,000 | 8,647 | ✗ over by 8% |
  | runtimeErrorRate | ≤ 0.05 | 0.00 | ✓ |
  | **avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable warm** | **≥ 2.0** | **2.25** | **✓ (was structurally unreachable in iter 8)** |
  | avgReuseRate warm | ≥ 0.30 | 0.31 | ✓ (barely) |
  | warm/train tokens | ≤ 0.70 | 1.575 | ✗ warm is 1.6× train |
  | quarantine rate | ≤ 0.03 | 0.00 | ✓ |
- Status: **PROBE CLEARED GATE.** Pass-rate gain vs iter4 baseline = +5.6pp (1.0 vs 0.944). At least one helper authored during train (4 over the run). Reuse rate on warm = 0.31 (meets the ≥ 0.30 cadence threshold).
- Lessons:
  1. **The headline iter 10 win is real.** Sub-graph extractor produced multiple distinct helpers per family, lifting `avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable warm` from 1.0 (iter 8 ceiling) to 2.25. The threshold the user flagged in STATUS.md as "structurally unreachable with today's observer" is now reachable.
  2. **Token efficiency is the new bottleneck.** Warm-tier tasks (m1, m2) where the agent abandoned the helpers and went manual cost 16-24 tool calls each. The crystallised helpers, while available, weren't structured in a way the agent felt confident using on harder tasks. This is iter 11 (re-rank) territory but the re-rank alone doesn't solve "the helper isn't useful enough for this harder task".
  3. **Mid-probe substrate bug-fix cadence worked.** Three bugs that would have made the entire eval cycle useless (per_entity TypeError, mirror-wipe, observer race) surfaced in the first 1-2 probe attempts and were each fixable within ~10-15 minutes once isolated via the saved trajectory + observer-debug script.

### iter14 validate: jikan + university with iter9-12 substrate
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 3 (A)
- Hypothesis: jikan-anime-analysis + university-directory-builder hold up across the iter9-12 substrate as well as tvmaze did; either clears ≥ 30% reuseRate on the warm tier per the cadence rule.
- Validate (claude-sonnet-4-6, hooks-draft, lib-cache on, 12 episodes total):
  - 12/12 episodes PASS evaluator.
  - Per family:
    | family | n | pass | tokens | reuse | helpersAvail |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | jikan-anime-analysis | 6 | 100% | 6,804 | 0.37 | 1.67 |
    | university-directory-builder | 6 | 100% | 7,646 | 0.10 | 2.17 |
  - jikan-anime-analysis warm reuse = 0.30 (meets cadence's "≥ 30% on warm tier of either family").
  - Per tier (combined): train n=2 tokens=7913 reuse=0.5, warm n=8 tokens=7769 reuse=0.20, hard n=2 tokens=4360 reuse=0.08.
- 5/7 thresholds met (combined; same shape as the tvmaze probe):
  | Threshold | Target | Observed | Status |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | passRate | ≥ 0.92 | 1.00 | ✓ |
  | avgEffectiveTokens (arm) | ≤ 8,000 | 7,225 | ✓ |
  | runtimeErrorRate | ≤ 0.05 | 0.00 | ✓ |
  | avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable warm | ≥ 2.0 | 2.25 | ✓ |
  | avgReuseRate warm | ≥ 0.30 | 0.20 | ✗ |
  | warm/train tokens | ≤ 0.70 | 0.98 | ✗ |
  | quarantine rate | ≤ 0.03 | 0.00 | ✓ |
- Status: **VALIDATE CLEARS CADENCE GATE.** jikan satisfies the ≥ 30% reuseRate requirement on the warm tier. Pass rate +5.6pp over iter4 baseline. Proceeding to full-126.
- Lessons:
  1. **Reuse rate is family-bimodal.** jikan reaches 0.37 reuse (helpers fit the task shape); university stalls at 0.10 (helpers exist but the agent goes manual on harder tasks). On the full 126-task surface, the warm-tier average reuse depends on how many families look like jikan vs how many look like university.
  2. **Warm-tier tokens are not consistently below train**. The 0.70 ratio threshold assumes the substrate's learning loop produces strictly cheaper warm tasks. In practice, warm-tier difficulty (more entities, more tools) costs tokens even when reuse fires. Either the ratio threshold over-promises, or the substrate needs a separate prompt nudge to keep tokens flat as task difficulty rises.

### iter14 full-126: dry run + gap analysis
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 3 (A)
- Hypothesis: with iter9-12 substrate + the three bugfixes + iter 10 sub-graph extraction, the full SkillCraft 126-task surface clears all 7 thresholds.
- Full-126 (claude-sonnet-4-6, hooks-draft, lib-cache on, 4 shards parallel, ~2h25m wall):
  - 126/126 episodes ran.
  - **Pass rate: 73.8% (93 of 126), DOWN from iter4 baseline 94.4%.** This is the headline regression.
  - Per tier: train (n=21) pass=71%, warm (n=84) pass=74%, hard (n=21) pass=76%.
  - 3/7 thresholds met:

  - 3/21 families clear warm reuse ≥ 0.30.
  - 4/21 families clear warm helpersAvail ≥ 2.0.
- **Root cause analysis — pass rate regression:**
  - Examined cat-facts-collector (0/6 pass): all episodes had snippetExitCode=0 (answer.ts ran successfully and returned df.answer) but evaluator rejected the output as wrong.
  - The agent's e1 answer.ts uses `entities.map((e) => e.id)` for entityIds passed to `df.lib.per_entity({entityIds, ...})`. The seed forwards entityIds as `{breed_name: <id>}` to the local catfacts tool.
  - `record.id` is `"cat-facts-collector:siamese"` (family-prefixed for global uniqueness). The catfacts tool expects `breed_name: "Siamese"` (matching the entity field).
  - The agent picked the wrong field. The prompt mentions `id`, `entity`, `label`, `attributes` but doesn't specify which to use as entityIds.
  - **The seed and the substrate-rooted prompt INTRODUCED a regression by giving the agent a primitive it uses incorrectly across many families.** Without lib-cache (iter4), the agent wrote per-entity tool calls directly using `attributes.<correct-field>`, getting 94.4% pass.
- **Root cause analysis — reuse/helpersAvail thresholds:**
  - Iter 10 sub-graph extractor produced multiple helpers per family only when the agent's e1 trajectory had ≥ 3 top-level tool calls in addition to db + lib. Most families' e1 answer.ts has shape `[db, lib.per_entity x N]` — a 2-call trajectory whose only sub-graph is itself. No sub-graphs emitted in those families.
  - 4/21 families have warm helpersAvail ≥ 2.0: tvmaze, dnd-campaign-builder, name-demographics-analyzer, rickmorty-multiverse-explorer (all had agent fan-out trajectories at top level).
  - Even in families with multiple helpers, agents don't always call them: when a helper is for a specific (entity, tool) combo, it doesn't fit a different task in the family.
- Status: **FULL-126 RAN; 3/7 THRESHOLDS, REGRESSION ON PASS RATE.** Goal 3 (A) not satisfied. Goal 3 (B) — novel-tenant smoke — passed earlier (11/11). The substrate's learning loop fires (helpers crystallise, get reused in some families) but introduces a correctness regression via the seed's misuse.
- Lessons:
  1. **The per_entity seed needs an entity-ID convention the agent can find without ambiguity.** Three reasonable choices: (a) rename `record.id` to `record.recordKey` and have `record.id` be the raw entity name; (b) make per_entity smart enough to strip family prefixes from entityIds when present; (c) tighten the prompt to explicitly say "use `record.entity` as entityIds, NOT `record.id`". (c) is the lowest-risk and most generic.
  2. **The sub-graph extractor only helps when the agent's e1 trajectory has top-level tool calls.** When the agent uses per_entity as a one-step wrapper, sub-graphs don't emerge. The lever's reach is gated by agent behavior.
  3. **Iter4 baseline's 94.4% was on a substrate WITHOUT the learning loop firing.** Re-introducing the loop without fixing the entity-id convention regressed pass rate. The thing the loop "learned" was (in many cases) misleading.
  4. **Goal 3 (B) holds (novel-tenant smoke 11/11).** The substrate's "works out of the box" claim is demonstrable on a new tenant. The 5707854b reframing of Goal 3 to spirit-of-the-project terms is supported by the part-B proof even though part-A regressed.

#### iter14 architect-diagnosed normalizer bug (2026-05-13 14:05)

A codex architect consultation surfaced a NORMALIZER false-negative that masked ~15pp of measured pass rate: `eval/skillcraft/scripts/normalize-results.ts` was flagging rows as `infrastructure_error` when the agent timed out (`agentExitCode=143` SIGTERM with `llmCalls=0, totalTokens=0`) — even when the snippet ran cleanly and the official evaluator scored the output ≥ 70. 19 of 126 rows were affected.

Patch: in `normalize-results.ts:175`, guard the "agent exit" branch of `infrastructureFailure` behind `!evalAcceptedOutput`, where `evalAcceptedOutput = snippetExitCode===0 && (officialPassed || score >= 70)`. The patch preserves the diagnostic signal for the true `model_usage_limit` and `officialStatus === "infrastructure_error"` paths and for the case where the snippet ALSO failed.

Re-analyzed iter14 numbers with the fix:

| Threshold | Target | Observed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| passRate | ≥ 0.92 | **0.889** | ✗ -3.1pp short of target (was 0.738) |
| avgEffectiveTokens (arm) | ≤ 8,000 | 3,993 | ✓ |
| runtimeErrorRate | ≤ 0.05 | 0.032 | ✓ |
| avgLearnedInterfacesAvailable warm | ≥ 2.0 | 1.08 | ✗ |
| avgReuseRate warm | ≥ 0.30 | 0.153 | ✗ |
| warm/train tokens | ≤ 0.70 | 0.89 | ✗ |
| quarantine rate | ≤ 0.03 | 0.00 | ✓ |

3/7 thresholds; pass rate at 0.889 vs iter4 baseline 0.944 → the substrate's learning loop costs ~5.5pp of pass rate in exchange for the loop firing. The architect's second finding (the EvalRecord `id`/`entity` confusion for `per_entity` callers) accounts for most of that 5.5pp.

### iter13: novel-tenant smoke
- Date: 2026-05-13
- Goal: Goal 3 (B, the generic-substrate proof)
- Hypothesis: the four iter9-12 substrate changes ship without any tenant-specific code, so a 5-record synthetic dataset under a new tenant id should let the observer crystallise a helper without any substrate edits.
- Change: new `src/observer/__smoke__/novel-tenant.ts`. Mounts a 5-record book catalogue under `novel-tenant-smoke`, drops a single substrate-level seed `summariseRecords` under `lib/__seed__/`, runs `db.records.findExact -> lib.summariseRecords`, asserts the observer crystallises a helper at `<baseDir>/lib/novel-tenant-smoke/`, then re-runs and asserts the crystallised helper is called.
- Result: **11/11 checks pass.** Observer crystallised `summariserecords` under `<baseDir>/lib/novel-tenant-smoke/`. Second snippet's trajectory call list includes `lib.summariserecords` with zero LLM calls.
- Status: **PASSED.** Goal 3 (B) clears on a 5-record dataset; the substrate's "works out of the box" claim is demonstrable end-to-end.
- Lessons:
  1. **Zero substrate edits required for a new tenant.** Only the test file is new; everything under `src/observer/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/snippet/`, `src/sdk/`, `src/adapter/` is untouched.
  2. **The crystallised helper's input shape mirrors the trajectory's external params, NOT the originating call's input.** First test attempt failed with `SchemaValidationError` because the second snippet passed `{rows}` (the internal binding) instead of `{filter, limit}` (the external params). Documenting because future tenant-onboarding will hit the same gotcha — the public signature is the substrate's contract, not the trajectory's call shape.
- Artefacts:
  - Smoke: `src/observer/__smoke__/novel-tenant.ts`
  - Crystallised file (run-specific): `/tmp/df-novel-tenant-smoke-*/lib/novel-tenant-smoke/summariserecords.ts`

## Current goal (Goal 4: intent-convergence crystallisation + learning-honest rubric)

### G4.1: artifact walker — make the learning-honest rubric scoreable
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Goal: Goal 4
- Hypothesis: the rubric R6-R9 cannot be scored from `episodes.jsonl` (counts only); a read-only artifact-walk pass that records helper names / called-helper identities / seed-vs-learned / origin / quarantine makes it scoreable without any substrate behaviour change.
- Lever: eval tooling (`eval/skillcraft/scripts/walk-artifacts.ts`)
- Change: new walker emits `helper-instrumentation.jsonl` — per episode: helpersAvailable / helpersAfterAgent / helpersCreatedThisEpisode / helpersCalled (seed-excluded) / seedCalled / helperOrigins (shapeHash + originTrajectory + intentSignature slot, read from the crystallised `.ts` file headers because the persisted hook manifests have empty `origin.trajectoryIds`) / quarantinedHelpers. Commit `b3b2e18c`.
- Probe: n/a (offline tooling).
- Result: 126 instrumentation rows from the iter14 full-126. Dry-score confirms the Goal 4 thesis:
  - R7 conditional reuse = **0.19** (58 warm episodes had a learned helper available; only 11 called one) vs target ≥ 0.60.
  - R6 convergence = **1 of 28** shapeHash clusters has ≥ 2 origin trajectories — the syntactic `shapeHash` fragments one intent into 28 data-shape-specific clusters.
- Status: **PASSED** (instrumentation lands; rubric now scoreable).
- Lessons:
  1. The persisted hook manifests are NOT a provenance source — `origin.trajectoryIds` is empty because manifests are re-created on lib-cache hydration. The crystallised `.ts` file headers (`@shape-hash`, `@origin-trajectory`) are the only stable origin.
  2. The dry-score is the empirical case for Goal 4: `shapeHash` clustering yields 1 convergent cluster out of 28; intentSignature has to do better or the redesign is pointless.
- Artefacts:
  - Walker: `eval/skillcraft/scripts/walk-artifacts.ts`
  - Instrumentation: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal3-iter14-full-20260513-113222/helper-instrumentation.jsonl`

### G4.2: offline intentSignature analyzer — the de-risk gate
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Goal: Goal 4
- Hypothesis: a data-shape-agnostic `intentSignature` (primitive categories + fan-out detection + structural slot abstraction) clusters trajectories far better than `shapeHash` — and if it does NOT cluster cleanly here, the whole redesign stops before any eval spend.
- Lever: eval tooling (`eval/skillcraft/scripts/intent-cluster-analysis.ts`)
- Change: offline analyzer over the iter14 full-126 + iter15 subset trajectory artifacts. Signature spec v2 (pinned below).
- Probe: n/a (offline tooling).
- Result over 146 answer-trajectories:
  | metric | shapeHash (G4.1 dry-score) | intentSignature v2 |
  |---|---|---|
  | clusters | 28 | **55** |
  | multi-trajectory (≥2) clusters | 1 | **22** |
  | cross-family (≥2 families) clusters | ~0 | **17** |
  | incoherent clusters (signature bug) | n/a | **0** |
  - Dominant cluster `db→FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)→lib`: **n=35, spans 10 families** with completely different data shapes (cat-facts, cocktail, dnd-monster, dog-breeds, jsonplaceholder, name-demographics, random-user, usgs, vocabulary, world-bank). This is the cross-shape-transfer property (R9) — and it IS the `per_entity` pattern, so the substrate can *learn* per_entity from convergence (Change 5 stretch is viable).
  - v1 → v2 refinement: v1 keyed fan-out on (category + input-field-set), which (a) made capability slots a noisy union of every family's concrete field names and (b) failed to collapse interleaved multi-tool fan-out (A,B,C,A,B,C). v2 keys fan-out on category alone and carries STRUCTURAL slots (varying/shared field counts, cycle width) — never concrete names. v2: 55 clusters (down from v1's 70), 17 cross-family (up from 13).
- Status: **PASSED — de-risk verdict is PROCEED.** The signature clusters cleanly (0 incoherent), cross-shape transfer is real, and the dry-run helper schema for the dominant cluster is a coherent generic helper (`fn({ intent, input: { filter?, limit?, entityValues, paramName, toolNames, sharedInput?, aggregateInput? }, body: replays db→FANOUT(tool,N)→lib })`).
- Lessons:
  1. **The signature MUST carry structure, not names.** v1's nominal capability slots (18 on the top cluster) would have made parameterised authoring impossible — the architect's "over-coarse signature feeds an under-powered author" risk, caught offline before any eval spend exactly as intended.
  2. **Fan-out detection on category alone is the right call.** Keying on input-field-set fragments interleaved fan-out; category-only collapses it and the cluster count drops.
  3. The dominant intent is the fan-out pattern across 10 families — strong evidence the substrate should learn the fan-out interface rather than ship `per_entity` as a seed.
- Pinned `intentSignature` spec v2 (for Goal 4 iter 3-4 to implement in the observer):
  - Map each top-level call to a CATEGORY: `db` / `lib` / `tool`. Concrete primitive + field names are dropped.
  - Collapse a maximal run of ≥ 2 consecutive SAME-CATEGORY calls into `FANOUT(category, degreeBucket, cycle<distinctInputShapes>)`. degreeBucket ∈ {2, 3-5, 6+}.
  - Per FANOUT node carry structural slots: `varyingFieldCount` / `sharedFieldCount` (fields whose value differs across the run vs constant). Concrete field names are report-only, never in the key.
  - signature = `→`-joined skeleton.
- Artefacts:
  - Analyzer: `eval/skillcraft/scripts/intent-cluster-analysis.ts`
  - Cluster report: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal4-iter2-intent-clusters.json`

### G4.3-6: intentSignature in the observer + convergence gate + parameterised authoring + cross-shape smoke
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Goal: Goal 4
- Hypothesis: porting the validated v2 intentSignature into the observer, gating crystallisation on >=2-trajectory convergence, authoring pure fan-outs as parameterised helpers, and proving cross-shape transfer in a smoke moves the substrate from "learn from one trajectory, syntactic key" to "learn from convergence, data-shape-agnostic key" — without an eval-cost regression on pass rate.
- Lever: observer template + gate + new convergence index + author + transfer smoke
- Change (commits `c7d44f7b`, `<iter4>`, `a5d06ffb`, `d8c6bc8f`):
  - iter 3: `intentSignature` on `CallTemplate` (category skeleton + FANOUT collapse); `extractNestedTemplates` groups depth>=1 calls by `scope.parentPrimitive`. Behaviour-preserving.
  - iter 4: `src/observer/convergenceIndex.ts` (append-only per-tenant JSONL); gate check #7 (crystallise only at >=N=2 distinct convergent trajectories); worker unified candidate loop wiring nested templates + recording qualifying intents; eval hydrate/persist carries the index per-family. Smokes updated to run the crystalliser twice.
  - iter 5: `renderFanOutSource` — pure tool fan-out templates author as parameterised per_entity-shaped helpers (toolBundle/toolNames/paramName always input params, never frozen).
  - iter 6: `cross-shape-transfer.ts` smoke — a fan-out helper learned from "widgets" runs on "gadgets" (8/8).
- Probe (tvmaze, iter 4 convergence gate): helpers available per episode 0,0,1,1,2,3 — crystallisation correctly starts after e1 records and e2 converges. 6/6 pass. intent-index persisted `FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)` across 5 distinct trajectories.
- Probe (tvmaze, iter 4+5 combined): helpers available 0,0,3,4,4,5; pass 5/6 (h1 failed — consistent with prior tvmaze probes, not a regression). The nested-template helpers (`tvmazeApiLocalTvmazeGetShowInfoNe`, `...GetShowCastNe`, `...GetShowSeasons`) are all PARAMETERISED (`df.tool[input.toolBundle]`, no frozen bundle).
- Status: **PASSED — iters 3-6 land; convergence-gated, data-shape-agnostic crystallisation is live and probe-verified.** Pausing before iter 7 (instrumented full-126) per the user's cadence choice.
- Lessons:
  1. **Convergence gate behaves exactly as designed**: e1 records intents (count=1, not crystallised), e2 converges (count=2, crystallises), e3+ reuse. The intent-index travels with the per-family lib-cache.
  2. **The smokes had to change with the behaviour.** Single-trajectory crystallisation is gone; the finqa + novel-tenant smokes now run the crystalliser twice and assert "first records, second crystallises." The demo pins `DATAFETCH_CONVERGENCE_N=1` to keep its 2-question narrative.
  3. **Parameterised authoring targets pure tool fan-outs.** `...Ne` nested-template helpers (the internal fan-out of `lib.per_entity`-style bodies) are exactly that shape and author parameterised. Sub-graph `_fanout` templates whose steps are `lib.*` calls (not `tool.*`) correctly fall through to the generic path.
  4. **R9 is proven in isolation** (cross-shape-transfer smoke 8/8) but the full-126's family-partitioned lib-cache means the headline R9 measurement still needs the deliberate transfer harness wired into the eval — a known iter-7+ item.
- Artefacts:
  - Probe dirs: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal4-iter4-probe-tvmaze-*`, `goal4-iter56-probe-tvmaze-*`
  - New substrate: `src/observer/convergenceIndex.ts`; new smoke: `src/observer/__smoke__/cross-shape-transfer.ts`

### G4.7: Codex `gpt-5.4-mini` instrumented full-126 — operational, but fails the learning-honest gates
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Goal: Goal 4
- Hypothesis: with Sonnet 429-walled, the Codex backend can run the instrumented full-126 on the newer/cheaper `gpt-5.4-mini`; if quality and cost hold, use it for the Goal 4 scorecard run.
- Lever: eval harness configurability + measurement. The full runner now accepts `DATAFETCH_AGENT`, `DF_SKILLCRAFT_FULL_MODEL`, `DF_SKILLCRAFT_FULL_REASONING_EFFORT`; the Codex path accepts `CODEX_BIN` and `CODEX_SANDBOX`, uses the current `codex exec` flag order, and no longer passes stale unsupported flags.
- Change:
  - `scripts/goal2-full.sh` can run either Claude or Codex. Codex defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`; Claude keeps `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
  - `src/eval/skillcraftDatafetch.ts` and `src/eval/skillcraftFullDatafetch.ts` use `CODEX_BIN` because `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex` (`0.77.0`) rejects newer model names, while `/Users/jayfarei/.bun/bin/codex` (`0.130.0`) accepts `gpt-5.4-mini`.
  - The live prompt now explicitly keeps agents inside the episode workspace, and probe commands use `pnpm datafetch:run "$PWD/scripts/probe.ts"` so the runner resolves the episode workspace correctly.
- Probe:
  - Sonnet guard probe confirmed the 429 condition: zero useful tokens / agent exit failures.
  - Codex guard probe: `goal4-iter7-probe-university-codex54mini-20260514-135657`, `6/6` pass on `university-directory-builder`, but very high token use (`avgEffectiveTokens=68,271.5`).
  - A first Codex full attempt was discarded because, before the workspace guard + `CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write`, agents wrote root-level scratch files. The valid run below used the fixed prompt and sandbox.
- Full run:
  - Command shape: `CODEX_BIN=/Users/jayfarei/.bun/bin/codex CODEX_SANDBOX=workspace-write DATAFETCH_AGENT=codex DF_SKILLCRAFT_FULL_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini DF_SKILLCRAFT_FULL_REASONING_EFFORT=low ITER_TAG=goal4-iter7 bash scripts/goal2-full.sh`
  - Run base: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal4-iter7-full-20260514-142538`
  - Scorecard: `eval/skillcraft/results/datafetch/goal4-iter7-full-20260514-142538/r1-r9-scorecard.json`
- Result:
  | gate | result |
  |---|---|
  | R1 passRate >= 0.92 | **FAIL** — `0.8492` |
  | R2 avgEffectiveTokens <= 8,000 | **FAIL** — `39,240.4` |
  | R3 runtimeErrorRate <= 0.05 | **FAIL** — `0.0952` |
  | R4 quarantine <= 0.03 | **PASS** — `0.0263` |
  | R5 novel-tenant smoke | **PASS** — `pnpm test` green; novel-tenant smoke `11/11` |
  | R6 convergence >= 0.80 | **FAIL** — `0.1333` (`2/15` qualifying clusters converged) |
  | R7 conditional reuse >= 0.60 | **FAIL** — `0` (`0/8` same-intent-helper-available warm episodes reused one; seed excluded) |
  | R8 conditional cost-drop <= 0.70 | **UNSCORED** — no paired reuse episodes |
  | R9 cross-shape transfer | **PASS in scorecard** — `db→FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)→lib` via `perEntity` across `tvmaze-series-analyzer` and `vocabulary-builder`; treat as weak/seed-mediated compared with the dedicated cross-shape smoke |
- Per-tier breakdown:
  - train: `21` episodes, pass `0.9524`, avgEffectiveTokens `41,241.6`, runtime errors `1`
  - warm: `84` episodes, pass `0.8333`, avgEffectiveTokens `39,155.8`, runtime errors `10`
  - hard: `21` episodes, pass `0.8095`, avgEffectiveTokens `37,577.4`, runtime errors `1`
- Diagnostics:
  - `normalizerCrossCheck.ge70ButNotPassed = 0`; the previous normalizer false-negative did not recur.
  - `signatureJoinDiagnostic`: `2/5` crystallised helper signatures intersect the `45` cluster signatures; `23` crystallised helpers have no usable signature. The dominant cluster `db→FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)→lib` has `44` successful trajectories but no callable learned helper attached, which is the clearest R6 gap.
- Status: **FAILED — useful measurement, not Goal 4 met.** `gpt-5.4-mini` is mechanically usable through the newer Codex CLI and is a reasonable cheap/probe backend, but this run shows it is not a drop-in headline backend for Goal 4: correctness misses R1 and token use misses R2 by ~5x. The next accepted iteration should target the R6/R7 structural gap (nested/helper signature join + learned-helper reuse) or deliberately compare a stronger Codex model; do not rerun this exact setup as the next step.

### G4.8: learned fan-out discoverability + hooks-draft probe — helper reuse appears, but not enough
- Date: 2026-05-14
- Goal: Goal 4
- Hypothesis: the iter-7 R6/R7 miss is partly substrate-facing: the transferable helper body exists, but the agent sees family-shaped names / weak `df.d.ts` declarations, and hydrated helpers are not callable unless the run uses `hooks-draft`. If pure fan-out helpers are generically named, documented in `df.d.ts`, and exposed under hooks-draft, small probes should show actual learned-helper calls before another full-126.
- Lever: observer template + author metadata + SkillCraft live workspace manifest/prompt.
- Change:
  - Pure tool fan-outs now get generic names such as `toolFanout6PlusCycle1` instead of tool/family-shaped names.
  - Added a record-backed fan-out author path (`recordToolFanout*`) that can learn the `db→FANOUT(tool,*)→lib.per_entity` shape without wrapping the `per_entity` seed.
  - The SkillCraft live `df.d.ts` now includes frontmatter/JSDoc and stricter declarations for listed helpers, and the prompt says to call only helpers already listed in `df.d.ts`; newly authored helpers are for later episodes.
- Probe sequence:
  | run | mode | result |
  |---|---|---|
  | `goal4-iter8-probe-tvmaze-20260514` | default `hooks-candidate-only` | `4/6` pass; `R6=1.0`, but `R7=0`; `toolFanout6PlusCycle1` was available but the agent kept using the seed path. |
  | `goal4-iter8-probe-tvmaze-recordfanout-20260514` | default `hooks-candidate-only` | `0/6` pass; agents called newly authored same-episode helpers that the registry correctly rejected as not callable. Diagnostic only. |
  | `goal4-iter8-probe-tvmaze-listedonly-20260514` | default `hooks-candidate-only` | `2/6` pass; agent selected `toolFanout6PlusCycle1`, but the registry rejected it as observed-only. Diagnostic only; wrong interface mode. |
  | `goal4-iter8-probe-tvmaze-hooksdraft-20260514` | `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft` | `5/6` pass; `toolFanout6PlusCycle1` promoted and was actually called in `m2` and `h1` (`helpersCalled=["toolFanout6PlusCycle1"]`, seed not called). R1/R2/R3/R6 still fail on the probe; R7 remains unscored by the exact-signature scorer. |
- Hooks-draft scorecard (`goal4-iter8-probe-tvmaze-hooksdraft-20260514/r1-r9-scorecard.json`):
  - R1 `0.8333` — FAIL.
  - R2 `37,990.8` avg effective tokens — FAIL.
  - R3 `0.1667` runtime error rate — FAIL (`e2` syntax error).
  - R4 `0` quarantine — PASS.
  - R6 `0` — FAIL under exact-signature scoring.
  - R7 `null` — no exact same-intent warm denominator, even though `m2` calls the learned pure fan-out helper.
  - Signature join: `0/1` helper signatures intersect `3` cluster signatures. The helper signature is `FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)` while successful trajectories cluster as surrounding compositions (`db→FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)`, `FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)→lib`, `db→FANOUT(tool,6+,cycle1)→lib`).
- Status: **PARTIAL / NOT ACCEPTED FOR FULL-126.** We proved one important behavioural step: under the correct `hooks-draft` mode, Codex does call the learned non-seed helper in later episodes. But the probe still misses pass, cost, runtime, and exact R6/R7 gates, so it does not satisfy the single-family precondition for a full run.
- Lessons:
  1. **Always set `DATAFETCH_INTERFACE_MODE=hooks-draft` for Goal 4 behavioural probes.** The default `hooks-candidate-only` is a deliberate non-callable baseline and creates misleading failures.
  2. **Selection improved only after `df.d.ts` carried helper descriptions and the lib index signature was removed.** In hooks-draft, `m2` and `h1` called `toolFanout6PlusCycle1`; that is real learned-helper reuse, not seed-only reuse.
  3. **The current R6/R7 scorer is exact-whole-signature only.** It misses real compositional reuse when the learned helper covers the fan-out sub-intent inside a larger trajectory. The next substrate/scoring iteration should explicitly decide whether R6/R7 measure whole-intent helpers only or compositional sub-intent coverage; if the latter, update the scorer and prove paired cost drops over small probes before any full-126.
  4. **Pass/cost still need work.** The best valid probe is only `5/6`, avg effective tokens are still ~38k, and `m1` used 78k effective tokens. A scorer alignment alone would be insufficient.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm vitest run tests/observer-template.test.ts tests/observer-author.test.ts` — 29/29.
  - `pnpm typecheck` — pass.
  - `pnpm test` — smokes green, cross-shape-transfer `8/8`, novel-tenant `11/11`, Vitest `271/271`.

### EN-P1-followup: AST rewriter swap + envelope-unwrap fix (3 anti-patterns addressed)
- Date: 2026-05-18
- Goal: address the three anti-pattern episodes that regressed in P1 paired comparison without changing the rubric or introducing benchmark identifiers.
- Hypothesis: each of the 3 P1 anti-pattern episodes (pokeapi-pokedex/m1, random-user-database/m2, recipe-cookbook-builder/e3) is a deterministic substrate defect, not stochastic noise. Fixing them recovers the episodes; the substrate's pass-rate dimension catches up to the substrate-OFF arm.
- Lever: substrate code only — three commits, each in its own worktree, each merged into local main via fast-forward.
- Change:
  1. `rewriteMixedNullishLogicalExpressions` swapped to AST-based implementation (commit `14bae808`). Walks every `BinaryExpression` whose operator is `??`/`||`/`&&` and whose child is a `BinaryExpression` in the other operator family; range-patches parens around the child. Codex consulted on the architectural choice; verified that the TypeScript parser cleanly recovers from the failing inputs. Net diff -38 lines vs the four regex helpers it replaces.
  2. `unwrapToolPayload` extended with a generic single-non-metadata-key rule (commit `4555f968`). Handles tool responses like `{pokemon: {...}}` or `{show: {...}}` without smuggling benchmark identifiers back into the envelope-keys allowlist. Same change applied uniformly to the four template-generator instances in `src/observer/author.ts` and to the runtime `unwrap()` helper in `renderAnswerKitSource`.
  3. `rewriteUnsafeStringCoercionCalls` swapped to AST (commit `7d416692`). Same parser-shaped class as the mixed-nullish rewriter, same AST-locate + range-patch approach. Catches receivers with nested parens that the prior regex `[^()]*\?\?[^()]*` couldn't cross.
- Validation:
  - 15-case AST regression suite (positive cases the prior regex missed + negative idempotent cases) under `tests/ast-syntax-fix-prototype.test.ts`.
  - New `unwrap()` regression test in `tests/skillcraft-full-datafetch-planner.test.ts`.
  - Smoke runs: pokeapi-pokedex/m1 scored **91.4** with the fix (was 68.6 in P1, below the 70 pass threshold); usgs-earthquake-monitor/m2 still **100**; cocktail-menu-generator e1+e2 and dnd-campaign-builder e1+e2 all clean after the mixed-nullish swap.
- Projected re-eval: Arm A R1 climbs from 92.9% → ~95.2% (matching Arm B). 4-vector shifts from `{NEUTRAL, PASS, PASS, NEUTRAL}` toward `{NEUTRAL-leaning-positive, PASS, PASS, NEUTRAL}` or `{MARGINAL, PASS, PASS, NEUTRAL}`. Cost/wall PASS verdicts preserved (fixes reduce failed-then-retried loops on the same 3 episodes).
- Status: **LANDED, NOT YET RE-EVALUATED.** Definitive validation is the B1 full-126 re-eval.
- Lessons:
  1. The 15-rewriter chain in `prepareAnswerSourceForRuntime` is fine as a library of small specialised transforms. Only the parser-shaped sub-rewriters belong in AST form; the text/import/identifier ones should stay regex. Replacing all 15 would amplify parse cost and grow the file by 300-500 LOC without solving anything.
  2. Codex's explicit guidance: do NOT use the TypeScript printer in this codebase. Patch byte-ranges back-to-front so the 14 downstream regex rewriters still see source they recognise.
  3. The prior regex `rewriteMixedNullishLogicalExpressions` missed its own intended case (`return X;` inside function bodies) because the segment-walker tracked `()`/`[]` depth but not `{}`. AST coverage went from 2/11 to 11/11 on the regression cases.
  4. The envelope-unwrap fix illustrates the "no benchmark identifiers" rule under pressure. Re-adding `pokemon`/`species` to the allowlist would have been the quick fix; the principled fix (generic single-key-with-object-value rule) covers the same cases without re-introducing benchmark-shape.
